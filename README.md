The app should start very simple. CRUD actions on notes and notebooks and can increase in complexity as time goes. There is no expected end goal.

Assume that you are working with a great backend developer who can make the api behave however you like.

### task

Walk through how you would go about building this app.

Feel free to take the approach that makes most sense to you.
(ie - "I like to start with [routes|css|api calls|markup|docs|tests] first")

Don't worry about coding perfectly, but rather getting your general ideas across.
